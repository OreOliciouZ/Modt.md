## Donation

As you maybe already know running a server like this never comes with cheap costs. It'll need a lot of time to manage it and money ofc. I pay for this server rn and never did offer people to be able to support it. But now the time slowly comes that i cant take it alone anymore and want to offer packages for the server to support on the monthly fees i have to pay.

Either way i will offer now a subscription option with benefits. For now there will be only one option to donate money for the server. My PayPal account.

## PvE/NPC Behaviors

We have [MES](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1521905890) ships flying around.
Following is their general behavior:

* They spawn around “online” players.
* Some of them actively prey on players.
* They get stronger as your grids get larger.

Make sure to set up some auto turrets from early on!

## PvP Rules

- Treat each other with respect
- Fair fight
- No Newbe raids
- No offline raids

## Plugins

* Programmable blocks will "overheat" if the computation takes 0.3ms per frame.
* Type `!blocklimit mylimit` to see your status.
* Auto Ore Pick
* Quantum Hangar
* Gridbackup
* Rewards
* Death Counter
* Discord Bridge

## Auto Moderator
We have a bot that disables player grids that are consuming excess server resource.
You’ll receive a warning before the bot is about to kick in.
You can profile yourself with `!lag profile` before the punishment.

Following is some of general/typical measures to optimize your grids:

* Never spam more way conveyors, if staff is telling you to remove or change it, just do it!
* Never use a projection on a moving grid, simply convert it to a station
* Less conveyor ports. Tubes (2x ports) are favorable to junctions (6x ports).
* Less gas-related blocks. Vents, generators, tanks, hydrogen thrusters.
* Less production blocks on a moving grid.
* Less programmable blocks. For [Isy's Inventory Manager script](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1216126863), set the max ms to `0.05`.
