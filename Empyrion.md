## Donation

As you maybe already know running a server like this never comes with cheap costs. It'll need a lot of time to manage it and money ofc. I pay for this server rn and never did offer people to be able to support it. But now the time slowly comes that i cant take it alone anymore and want to offer packages for the server to support on the monthly fees i have to pay.

Either way i will offer now a subscription option with benefits. For now there will be only one option to donate money for the server. My PayPal account.

* Ability to use the donators chat and voice chat, which is visible only for donators

* Ability to write in the re-game-chat, which is the ingame chat

* A special "Thank You" position in the donators-list Discord channel for everyone to see

**For 10.00€ you can purchase the NPC Core:**

* You'll get 1x NPC Core which you can place on any build of your choice base/small vessel/large vessel. Once placed it wont consume any fuel or oxygen and runs unlimited
