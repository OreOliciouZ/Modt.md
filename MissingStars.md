## Donation

As you maybe already know running a server like this never comes with cheap costs. It'll need a lot of time to manage it and money ofc. I pay for this server rn and never did offer people to be able to support it. But now the time slowly comes that i cant take it alone anymore and want to offer packages for the server to support on the monthly fees i have to pay.

Either way i will offer now a subscription option with benefits. For now there will be only one option to donate money for the server. My PayPal account. 

**For 7.50€ per month, you receive these perks on the server:**

Supporter role on Discord

Ability to use the donators chat and voice chat, which is visible only for donators

Ability to write in the re-game-chat, which is the ingame chat

A special "Thank You" position in the donators-list Discord channel for everyone to see

**For 15€ you can purchase the Dark Matter Core Keys:**

You'll get 5x Dark Matter Core Keys which will give you the ability to craft the Dark Matter Core

**For 50€+ you will get:**

All rewards above +

You will get 2x SuperGates placed by me on the spot you wish, giving you the ability to warp your grids through it on the positions you've wished

Choose this option only with incredible generous intentions, without expecting anything back for it

I am really thankfull for every support and really appreciate it.

## PvE/NPC Behaviors

We have [MES](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1521905890) ships flying around.
Following is their general behavior:

* They spawn around “online” players.
* Some of them actively prey on players.
* They get stronger as your grids get larger.

Make sure to set up some auto turrets from early on!

## PvP Rules

- Treat each other with respect
- Fair fight (no offline raids)

## Plugins

* Programmable blocks will "overheat" if the computation takes 0.3ms per frame.
* Type `!blocklimit mylimit` to see your status.

## Auto Moderator
We have a bot that disables player grids that are consuming excess server resource.
You’ll receive a warning before the bot is about to kick in.
You can profile yourself with `!lag profile` before the punishment.

Following is some of general/typical measures to optimize your grids:

* Less conveyor ports. Tubes (2x ports) are favorable to junctions (6x ports).
* Less gas-related blocks. Vents, generators, tanks, hydrogen thrusters.
* Less production blocks on a moving grid.
* Less programmable blocks. For [Isy's Inventory Manager script](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1216126863), set the max ms to `0.05`.
