## Donation

As you maybe already know running a server like this never comes with cheap costs. It'll need a lot of time to manage it and money ofc. I pay for this server rn and never did offer people to be able to support it. But now the time slowly comes that i cant take it alone anymore and want to offer packages for the server to support on the monthly fees i have to pay.

Either way i will offer now a subscription option with benefits. For now there will be only one option to donate money for the server. My PayPal account. 

**For 5.00â‚¬** you receive permanent the **Donator rank:**

* Supporter role on Discord

* Ability to use the donators chat and voice chat, which is visible only for donators

* Ability to write in the game-chat, which is the ingame chat

* A special "Thank You" position in the donators-list Discord channel for everyone to see

* You'll get a reserved slot in the server loading list and up to 4 home teleport saves

* You'll get a special "Login Notice" which will be a message of your choice (will be globaly announced each login)

* You'll get a colorful name tag

Choose this options only with incredible generous intentions, without expecting anything back for it

I am really thankfull for every support and really appreciate it.

PLEASE WRITE IN THE INFORMATION SECTION YOUR IGN AND WHICH GAME
